<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


There are many CV builders available on the internet, however, I didn't find one that really suits my needs. I wanted to create a CV builder which is very simple to use and also has some standard templates in it, to start with. One of the most important things is that, this is an opensource project. "For the community and by the community" is what it makes powerful. Even if you aren't a developer, you can contribute to this project by filling out the feedback/suggestion form which is avalable on the home page.

Checkout the [contributing](#contributing) section, if you are a developer.

<!-- Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile: -->

You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people who have contributed to this project!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
